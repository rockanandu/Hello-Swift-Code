# Hello Swift

This GitHub repository contains the code for all the applications and playgrounds shown in the "Hello Swift! - iOS App Programming for Kids and Other Beginners" book.

## How to run apps taken from this repo

1. Download this GitHub repo and unzip the file. This will create a directory called `Hello-Swift-Code-master`. Navigate into this directory.
2. Navigate into whichever project folder you're interested in. For example, go to `1_Chapter11_LoadSaveChp10` to see the `Load Save` application from Chapter 11.
3. Open the `.xcodeproj` file for that project to launch this project in Xcode. For example, `FCMApp.xcodeproj` is the name of the Xcode Project for `1_Chapter11_LoadSaveChp10`.
4. Go to the Xcode Project window (which is the window you see when you click on the Xcode Project in the _File Explorer_ of Xcode - you will find this on the top left of your Xcode screen), and select your Apple ID Account Name from the `Teams` dropdown menu.
5. You can now run your app according to the instructions in Chapter 1 of Hello Swift!
